Programming Projects
Hi, my name is Jeremiah Suess and I am a software developer.  Some languages I know consist of: Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  I enjoy programming in my spare time and look forward to creating many projects throughout my life.  Thank you for your time, and have a great rest of your day.
